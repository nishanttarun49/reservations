            <p>Although most travel, including travel to international destinations, is completed without incident, travel to certain destinations may involve greater risk than others.

            <h2 class="content-sub-heading">TRAVEL RESERVATIONS</h2>
            <p>Travel Services are offered for sale on the basis of availability provided directly or through electronic global distribution systems by the carriers and suppliers for whom Alternative Airlines acts as agent. On rare occasions carriers may fail to keep this availability updated in real time and in the event that capacity is no longer available at the quoted price they may cancel reservations before tickets have been issued. In this event Alternative Airlines will attempt to offer a suitable alternative or we will refund any payment received but Alternative Airlines and its affiliates will not accept any liability for the consequences of cancelled reservations. In the event of a payment dispute Alternative Airlines reserves the right to cancel your booking without warning and no refund will be processed. </p>
            <h2 class="content-sub-heading">NO SHOW POLICY ON SCHEDULED FLIGHTS: </h2>
            <p>If you have booked a scheduled carrier and choose not to travel on the flights in the same order / sequence as booked, then your return flight will automatically be cancelled by the airline. The price you have paid is based on the routing you originally booked. Once the airline have cancelled the ticket, then it cannot be reinstated or refunded. This is not something that Alternative Airlines can change, it is an automated process that happens with the airlines directly. Therefore, if you know you cannot travel on the flights in the order booked you may need to amend or cancel the booking. This will be done under the ticket rules as you purchased.</p>
            <h2 class="content-sub-heading">Cancellation within 24 hours</h2>
            <p>Some airlines allow customers to cancel within 24 hours of booking their flights. Please be aware that this may only be applicable if you book direct with the airline. Please ensure you read the airlines terms and conditions. Alternative Airlines have no choice but to follow the airlines policies and have no influence over what the airline say.</p>
            <p>If your flight does fall under a policy that allows for a full refund within 24 hours. The 24 hours starts from when you confirm your booking. Alternative Airlines is open from 0800 - 2000 UK time, and if your 24 hour cancellation period expires whilst we are closed, and you contact us during this time, then you will not be entitled to a refund. You must contact us within our opening hours and allow us time to process the refund to quality for a refund.</p>
            <h2 class="content-sub-heading">Cancellation Protection</h2>
            <p>For certain non-refundable bookings we offer Cancellation Protection through our partner Refund Protect. This allows yourself or anyone in your party to be refunded 100% of your booking in the event that you or anyone in your party cannot attend due to one of the terms covered by Refund Protect.</p>
            <p>By choosing to protect your booking you provide permission for Alternative Airlines to send your name and booking details to Refund Protect in order to protect your booking and agree to their terms &amp; conditions.</p>
