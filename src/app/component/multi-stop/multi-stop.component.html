             <p class="biggerp">Multi-city flights allow you to hop around the world. Fancy a few days in Dubai on your way to Australia? Or a week beach bumming in Mexico on the way to Peru? Alternative Airline's multi-city flights allows you to <b>travel to more than one destination with only one search and purchase</b>. You can do a whirlwind 24 hour stopover or a few weeks somewhere new and exotic; the possibilities are endless. It's all about making the most of your bonus holiday time in an exotic destination, no matter how long you've got.</p>

             <h2 class="uppercase">What are multi-city flights?</h2>
             <p class="biggerp">With multi-city flights, you're able to visit as many different cities or countries as you can in one trip and make the most out of your time away. Flying is the most time-efficient way of travelling long distances. Long drives and train journeys take up precious holiday hours that could be spent seeing more of the world.</p>
             <p class="biggerp">Multi-city flights are also cheaper than making several individual trips to the same area at different points in your life. If you're interested in seeing multiple destinations within a certain country or continent, multiple city flights allow you to do it all in one trip and in the most economical way.</p>
